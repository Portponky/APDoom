Archipelago Doom is a fork of [Crispy Doom](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom), designed to play randomized MultiWorld games through [Archipelago](archipelago.gg).

## Running

### Windows

1. Download Archipelago Doom from the [release page](https://github.com/ArchipelagoDoom/APDoom/releases/latest).
   Windows users will want to download `apdoom-Windows-x64.zip`.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file into a new folder.
3. Run `apdoom-launcher.exe`.
4. Rip and tear!

### Linux

We distribute an AppImage for Linux users which should function regardless of the distro being used.

1. Download Archipelago Doom from the [release page](https://github.com/ArchipelagoDoom/APDoom/releases/latest).
   Linux users will want to download `APDoom-Linux-x86_64.AppImage`.
2. Make the AppImage executable if it isn't already. (`chmod +x APDoom-Linux-x86_64.AppImage`)
3. Run the AppImage.
4. Rip and tear!

### WAD files

Archipelago Doom should automatically detect the WAD files from the Steam releases of DOOM + DOOM II and Heretic + Hexen, if they are installed. Otherwise, copy any additional WAD files into the same directory as Archipelago Doom.

Archipelago Doom works best with the original DOS versions of the IWADs, not the rerelease versions. This means if you're copying from, say, the Steam release of DOOM + DOOM II, you want to copy the WAD files from the `/dos/base/` folder. While Archipelago Doom should still function with other WAD files, there may be visual glitches and support is not guaranteed.

## Compiling

**You should not need to compile the executable yourself just to play Archipelago Doom.**
Compiling is for those that wish to work on the game, fix bugs, etc.

**Do not attempt to use automake; the build files are left over from Crispy Doom and are nonfunctional.**
CMake is the only supported method of generating project files.

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ArchipelagoDoom/APDoom`
- Initialize submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
- Place any APWorlds that you want to be available by default in the `embed` directory.
  - **Beta note:** No APWorlds are currently included by default; ideally, you should generate some using ap_gen_tool, but you can take the officially distributed Beta APWorlds and place them in there too.
- Create a `build` directory inside the repository directory, and change directories into it.
- Use CMake to generate project files: `cmake ..`

### Libraries

I'm sorry in advance for how frustrating CMake can be to set up on Windows.
You will likely need to set the include and library directories up manually; using the CMake GUI may make things easier.

|Library|Required|Version|
|-|-|-|
|SDL2|**required**|>= 2.0.18|
|SDL2_mixer|**required**|>= 2.6.3|
|zlib|**required**|any recent version|
|libpng|_optional_|any recent version|
|libfluidsynth|_optional_|>= 2.3.2|
|libsamplerate|_optional_|0.2.2|

Once libraries have been set up, use CMake to generate project files for your platform.
For Windows you probably want to generate VS2022 project files, and for Linux you'll probably just want to generate a Makefile.

## ap_gen_tool

Archipelago Doom reads worlds generated with [ap_gen_tool](https://github.com/ArchipelagoDoom/ap_gen_tool) to determine which locations are available, what tweaks to maps need to be applied, etc. See the ap_gen_tool repository for more information.
